## Development Process

All variables are named clear and understandable. Also supported with comment lines.

Inheritance and encapsulation were used. And it was tried to use SOLID principles.

Singleton, Observer, Factory, MVC Design Patterns were tried to be used.

Also A* algorithm was tried to be used for unit movement. Actually it is not perfect but provides acceptable movement.
